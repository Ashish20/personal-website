I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at UC Irvine. My interests include database management systems, web application development, and operating systems. I have also explored Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence through my Master's program and was thrilled by the power of AI and Neural Networks. 

Previously, I used to work with Cisco as a Software Engineer where I got introduced to the world of Graph Database. I was fascinated by the idea of storing data in the unconventional form of Nodes and Edges which can exponentially improve the performance of a system and gives a totally different dimension of visualizing your data. Currently, I am exploring the fundamentals of an Operating System by studying in detail xv6, a modern re-implementation of one of the early UNIX Operating Systems. Also, I plan to develop a basic search engine through the Information Retrieval coursework.
